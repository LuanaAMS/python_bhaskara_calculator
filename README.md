The Bhaskara Calculator is a tool that allows users to solve quadratic equations. Quadratic equations are equations of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are real numbers.

The Bhaskara Calculator uses the Bhaskara formula to solve quadratic equations. The Bhaskara formula is:

x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
Where:
x is the solution to the equation
b is the coefficient of the linear term
a is the coefficient of the quadratic term
c is the independent term

The Bhaskara Calculator is a useful tool for students, engineers, and other professionals who need to solve quadratic equations.
